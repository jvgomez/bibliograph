This document contains the minimum requirements for the alpha version (a mock up to test the idea).

### Basic usage workflow
1. The user inputs a new reference.
	1. Minimum fields: ID, Author, Title, Year
2.	The user connects it to previously introduced references.
3.	A graph is shown: vertices are current references and edges their connections.
	1.	It is a directed graph.
	1.	It would be nice to have an interactive graph (colapse, expand, zoom, move, etc).
