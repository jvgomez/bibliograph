Design-related TODO list:

1. Check out [bibserver](https://github.com/okfn/bibserver) since it can be useful. Check out http://holtzermann17.github.io/skelodml/bibserver-setup.html and https://github.com/okfn/bibserver/issues/256 when installing.
2. Make a decision about initial program design.
3. Make a decision about initial technologies to use.

- Check out other applications such as:
  - https://github.com/jasonzou/MyPapers
- Give a try to Binding for JS: http://pyjs.org/

#### Static graph plotting:
- NetworkX, currently in use: can _export_ to use in D3.js
- Alternative to NetworkX: https://graph-tool.skewed.de/
- Graphviz provides good visualization: http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php
- Python alternative to plotting: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/
