Design-related TODO list:

1. Check out [bibserver](https://github.com/okfn/bibserver) since it can be useful.
2. Make a decision about initial program design.
3. Make a decision about initial technologies to use.
  3.1 Graph drawing with python:

  - Binding for js: http://pyjs.org/ (in case 3D.js is used)

  - Easy graphs (I think no interaction): https://networkx.github.io/
  Example: https://www.udacity.com/wiki/creating-network-graphs-with-python#creating-network-graphs-with-python

  - 3D.js style but in python: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/

  - Graph analysis oriented: https://graph-tool.skewed.de/

  - quite complicated: http://www.graphviz.org/Documentation.php
